POSIX Utilities implemented in Rust
===================================

This is a personal learning exercise (and very much a work in progress),  and there should be no practical use for this code ever!

These are implemented to hopefully conform to `IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 Edition <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/>`__.
